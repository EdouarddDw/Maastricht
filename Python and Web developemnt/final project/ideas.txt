got a couple of ideas:
- add an estimation of the number of hours a project will take so we can create nice graphs and shit
- log file of modififcations and who did input
-  have the admin aprove of hourse the employees submit
- gnereal page where the admin can who clocked in and when
- on employee dashboard allow the employee on what project he want to put the hourse in
- allows employees to have multiple projects
- make it a little more branded.


to do:
invalide password function works but shows up in the wrong place
