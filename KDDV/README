Here you can find all my assignments made for the "Knowledge Discovery and Data visualization" course in the first year of business analytics at Maastricht SBE.
Most assignments are based on chapters of "Discovering Knowledge in Data" by Larose, specifically the hands-on subchapters.
I hope it can be helpful to someone someday.

you will also find the take-at-home exam here with the dataset and all my work with it.

don't mind if the code is absolutely shit, I'm still learning here :)
